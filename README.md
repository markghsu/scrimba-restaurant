Restaurant project for scrimba

## Design
This app allows users to see food items on a menu: ![Food items in menu](images/default-state.jpg)

Users can then add items to their order: ![Menu with items added to order](images/pre-checkout-state.jpg)

When the order is complete, users are prompted to enter their payment information: ![Checkout modal](checkout-payment-modal-state.jpg)

Finally, users are notified that their order is on its way. ![Order finished notification below menu](order-complete-state.jpg)
